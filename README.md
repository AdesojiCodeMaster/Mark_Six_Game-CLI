### Game rules:
- The game board is a 5x10 grid.
- The player will make a request for a unique ticket and validate before playing.
- The default token for all players to mark the board is "XX". 
- The motive of the game is for the player to predict 6 numbers correctly out of numbers      rangiing from 1 to 49 on the board which must be the same with the game's lucky numbers.
- The player/players can mark anywhere on the board with the token to move round.
- If the player/players finished a draw, he will be asked to wait for 10seconds before playing 
a new game.
